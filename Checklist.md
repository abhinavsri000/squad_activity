# Checklist for the Project

## Logic Points

- [ ] Working Code
- [ ] Use factory patterns
- [ ] Rather than using Nested Loop, use a Straight Ladder
- [ ] Use a Flow of Code

## OOPS Points

- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Inheritence
- [ ] Private Variables


## Testing Points

- [ ] Unit Tests vs Integration Test
- [ ] Name tests as so : `should_Rotate_Strike_IfOne_Run_Scored_And_If_Over_Not_Finished`
- [ ] The aim of a test should be singular

## Readability Points

- [ ] Small Functions (Break Large Functions into utilities or multiple functions)
- [ ] Use Classes and behaviours indtead of huge if else blocks
- [ ] Good and Meaningful Naming
- [ ] Constant Variables instead of Numbers
- [ ] Use Language conventions
- [ ] Modularity is a must

## Data Structures Points

- [ ] Data needed to be binded toghether is better off binded structurally than logically (i.e. rather than array indexing make Classes)
- [ ] Use arrays only for sequential data, otherwise Maps

## Build Points

- [ ] Have a build file that installs all dependencies
- [ ] Have a way to run tests

## Extensibility Points

- [ ] No Duplication in the Code
- [ ] No Hardcoded Values
- [ ] Code can be extended to include more queries
- [ ] can be extended to include multiple parking lots
- [ ] can be extended to include multiple vehicles
